## What I did in my assignment.

-  I linked my **RStudio** and **GitHub**.  
-  I created an assignment repository in **GitHub**.  
-  I create *RStudio project* from the version control of the created repository.  

I have created two files:  

1.  R script for greeting (*greeting.R*)  
2.  R markdown about this assignment. (*assignment_assemble_toolbox_kmk.Rmd*)
